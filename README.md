## Description

A full functioning budgeting app that demonstrates Progressive Web App functionality.

## Usage

As a user I want to be able to use an applicaton that allows me to keep track of my expenses whether I am online or offline. This would prove useful in the business world esepcially if one is an avid traveller. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
